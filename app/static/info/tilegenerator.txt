This project is a C++ console application that demonstrates procedural world generation using a chunk-based system. It generates an infinite, explorable 2D terrain directly in the console window, utilizing noise algorithms to create organic terrain patterns. The application renders a viewport of the world based on the console window's size. As the player moves (using WASD or arrow keys), the engine calculates which chunks are visible. If a chunk exists in memory, it is rendered; if not, it is procedurally generated using FastNoise and cached.

In the rendered console viewport:
-(") represents grass
-(~) represents water
-(@) represents the player
